### About me:  

Hi! My name is Jesse. I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at Towson University, which is near Baltimore, MD. 🇺🇸 I am originally from Pori, Finland.  🇫🇮 

My interests are web/mobile development, data analytics, and SMB/enterprise software. In my free time, I like to play classical guitar. I'm looking forward to getting to know the OLE team and learning from you all as a **Software Engineering Intern.**   

Let's connect via [Github][2] or [LinkedIn][1]!  

Cheers! 

Jesse
